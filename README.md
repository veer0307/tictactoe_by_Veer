The provided Python code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with several functions to manage game logic and user interaction. It starts by defining initialize_board() to create an empty game board, represented as a list with spaces. The print_board(board) function displays the board in a formatted manner, showing row and column indices for clarity. To determine if a player has won, check_winner(board, player) checks all possible winning combinations
The check_draw(board) function checks if the game has ended in a draw by verifying if any empty spaces are left. The core of the game is handled by play_game(), which manages the main game loop. This function prompts players to enter their moves, updates the board, checks for wins or draws, updates scores, and allows players to replay the game or exit. The game alternates between players 'X' and 'O', validates input, and provides a complete game experience through text-based interactions
